# Taxchela Studio

A cinematic, animation-rich marketing site for the Taxchela finance studio. Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion so it can be hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) or any modern static host.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be emitted to `dist/`. Preview the build locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deploying to Render

1. Push this repository to GitHub (or another Git provider that Render supports).
2. Create a new **Web Service** in Render and connect the repo.
3. Use the following settings:
   - **Environment**: `Node`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm run preview -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - **Node version**: `18` (configured in `render.yaml`)
4. Deploy. Render will serve the static build through Vite’s preview server.

Alternatively, you can deploy as a **Static Site** on Render using `npm run build` as the build command and `dist` as the publish directory.

## Design system

- **Animations**: Driven by Framer Motion with custom easing, parallax layers, tilt-reactive galleries, and continuous marquee effects.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with bespoke gradients, glass panels, and motion-friendly typography.
- **Components**: Modular hero, services, case studies, process timeline, testimonials, and contact CTA sections.

## Legacy compatibility

If you still have Wix-specific branches that expect the old autogenerated file layout (for example `src/pages/Home.c1dmp.js`),
this repository now ships thin adapters that simply render the new single-page React application. This keeps long-running
branches mergeable while you migrate completely to the modern toolchain.

## Running this project on Render

Because this repository is tied directly to a Wix site, it relies on the Wix Local Editor runtime that `wix dev` spins up. That workflow requires an interactive browser session and Wix authentication, so it cannot run headlessly on Render or other third-party hosts. Instead, develop locally with `npm run dev` and publish through Wix. If you need more detail, see [docs/render-deployment.md](docs/render-deployment.md) for an explanation of the limitations and alternative approaches.
