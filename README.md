# TaxChela Enhanced Website

This repository now hosts the static TaxChela experience extracted from the `tccc.zip` archive and enriched with motion design
and CSV-powered content sections suitable for deployment on Render or any static host.

## Project structure

```

## Local development

1. Install dependencies (there are no packages to download, but this step ensures `npm` knows about the project scripts):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Launch the bundled static server helper:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The command proxies to `npx serve .` so you do not need a global install.
3. Visit the printed localhost URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

If you prefer another tooling option, any static server such as `python -m http.server` still works; just make
sure you start it from the project root so the CSV fetches resolve correctly.

## Deployment to Render

1. Push this repository to GitHub (or your preferred Git provider).
2. In Render, create a **Static Site**.
3. Set the build command to either `npm run build` (Render's default) or leave it empty — both succeed because the
   repository now ships with a no-op `build` script that simply prints `Static site build complete.`
4. Set the publish directory to `/` (root).
5. Enable auto-deploys so every push redeploys the latest assets.

Render will serve the site exactly as-is. Because the build step is intentionally lightweight, deploys are effectively
instantaneous even when Render executes `npm run build`.
3. Set the build command to `null`/empty and the publish directory to `/` (root).
4. Enable auto-deploys so every push redeploys the latest assets.

Render will serve the site exactly as-is. Because there is no build step, deploys are near instantaneous.

## Creating the distributable archive

Some platforms reject pull requests that contain binary assets such as `.zip` archives. To avoid those
limits while still producing the requested `TaxChela_Enhanced_Website.zip`, generate the bundle locally
whenever you need to share or upload it:

```bash
zip -r TaxChela_Enhanced_Website.zip \
  assets contri css data home js pp read sol tc index.html README.md
```

The command mirrors the earlier packaged archive and can be run after every update. Add the resulting
file to releases or deployment portals as required, but keep it out of git commits to preserve PR compatibility.

## Managing CSV-powered content

- `/data/blogs.csv` feeds the Insights grid on `/read`.
- `/data/products.csv` and `/data/categories.csv` feed the Solutions catalogue on `/sol`.

To update content:

1. Edit the relevant CSV file(s) with your new records.
2. Commit and push the changes.
3. The next Render deploy (automatic if enabled) will serve the updated entries without touching HTML.

Ensure the site is always served from a web server (local or hosted) so the fetch requests for CSV files succeed.
# Taxchela Studio

A cinematic, animation-rich marketing site for the Taxchela finance studio. Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion so it can be hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) or any modern static host.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be emitted to `dist/`. Preview the build locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deploying to Render

1. Push this repository to GitHub (or another Git provider that Render supports).
2. Create a new **Web Service** in Render and connect the repo.
3. Use the following settings:
   - **Environment**: `Node`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm run preview -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - **Node version**: `18` (configured in `render.yaml`)
4. Deploy. Render will serve the static build through Vite’s preview server.

Alternatively, you can deploy as a **Static Site** on Render using `npm run build` as the build command and `dist` as the publish directory.

## Design system

- **Animations**: Driven by Framer Motion with custom easing, parallax layers, tilt-reactive galleries, and continuous marquee effects.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with bespoke gradients, glass panels, and motion-friendly typography.
- **Components**: Modular hero, services, case studies, process timeline, testimonials, and contact CTA sections.

## Legacy compatibility

If you still have Wix-specific branches that expect the old autogenerated file layout (for example `src/pages/Home.c1dmp.js`),
this repository now ships thin adapters that simply render the new single-page React application. This keeps long-running
branches mergeable while you migrate completely to the modern toolchain.

## Running this project on Render

Because this repository is tied directly to a Wix site, it relies on the Wix Local Editor runtime that `wix dev` spins up. That workflow requires an interactive browser session and Wix authentication, so it cannot run headlessly on Render or other third-party hosts. Instead, develop locally with `npm run dev` and publish through Wix. If you need more detail, see [docs/render-deployment.md](docs/render-deployment.md) for an explanation of the limitations and alternative approaches.
